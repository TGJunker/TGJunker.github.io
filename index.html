        <h1>Why am I, the best possible human on Earth</h1>
        <p>Yeah you read the titel right. This website is all about me and my
        achiments in life! </p>
        <p> So maybe a small introduction is in order. Here is a small list of
        things in life that I like. </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Dogs </li>
          <li> Respect </li>
          <li> Probability theory </li>
        </ul>
        <p> I goddam love dogs over anything else in this world. Like seriously.
          And it is not just a specific dog breed, no it is all kinds of dogs.
          I dont know how it is possible but apparently dogs genes = Good boy.
          I should definitely go buy a dog after finishing this website.
