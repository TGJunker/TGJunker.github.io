        <p> I goddam love dogs over anything else in this world. Like seriously.
          And it is not just a specific dog breed, no, it is all kinds of dogs.
          I dont know how it is possible but apparently </p>
          <p class = "uplifting"> Dog genes = Good boy. </p>
          <p> I should definitely go buy a dog after finishing this website.</p>
